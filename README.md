The Event Planning App was developed to streamline the process of creating, managing, and attending events for individuals or groups. The primary goal was to address user needs around organizing social activities with ease—particularly by offering a centralized space to view upcoming events, RSVP, and manage personal schedules. This app targets users who are looking for a simplified, mobile-first experience that removes the friction commonly associated with coordinating events through text, email, or third-party calendar apps.

To support user needs and maintain a user-centered interface, several screens were designed, including the Home screen for event browsing, a Create Event screen for hosting new events, a My Events screen for tracking RSVPs and personal activity, and a Profile screen for customizing preferences. Each feature was crafted with accessibility and usability in mind—such as large clickable buttons, clear form validation messages, and an intuitive bottom navigation bar. The success of the design lies in its simplicity and responsiveness, ensuring that users can complete key actions with minimal effort.

The coding process began with outlining core functionalities and breaking them down into manageable components. I adopted a modular coding strategy in Android Studio, separating UI logic from backend interactions and using Java/Kotlin to ensure smooth data handling. XML was used to craft flexible and scalable layouts. These techniques helped keep the development structured and scalable. Going forward, I can apply these same methods to other app projects by reusing modular components and focusing on separation of concerns.

Testing was conducted through the Android emulator and device simulation tools to validate functional flows such as form submission, event retrieval, and user authentication. Manual testing helped catch edge-case bugs, and Logcat debugging was used to trace errors during runtime. This process was essential not just for stability, but also for improving the user experience by fixing responsiveness and interaction issues. It also reinforced the importance of testing early and often.

Throughout the full development cycle—from wireframing to launch planning—several challenges required innovative thinking. One such challenge was building a functional input validation system for the event creation form that handled both empty fields and incorrect formats without frustrating the user. I implemented real-time feedback and conditional error messages that helped improve usability without cluttering the UI.

A particularly successful component of the app was the integration of the Create Event feature, which not only showcased my backend development knowledge but also highlighted my ability to create clean and usable form layouts. The form logic, which ensured error-free submissions and provided confirmation feedback, stands out as a testament to my growing skill set in mobile application development.
